# Welcome

This repository contains source of Alice voice assistant skill which provides opportunity to get information about schedule for students of the ITMO University in Saint-Petersburg.

The project is in development, so there is no opportunity to parse schedule directly from ISU, so it's hardcoded in app.ts file, but it will be realized asap.
